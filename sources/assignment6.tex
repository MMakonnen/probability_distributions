\section{Assignment 6, TBD}


\subsection{Have you read well?}

\begin{exercise}
Here is (what I find) a simpler proof of the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality.  Define  $f(t) = \E{(Y-tX)^2}$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Explain that $f(t)\geq 0$.
\item Write $f(t) = \E{(Y-tX)^2}$ as a polynomial of the second degree, i.e., in the form $f(t) = a t^2 + b t + c$ (Hint, see BH).
\item Since $f(t) \geq 0$, how many (real) roots can it have at most?
\item What are the implications of this for the discriminant $D=b^2-4ac$?
\item Show that the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality directly follows.
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
And here is inequality from which all inequalities in BH 10.1.3 immediately follow.
Take any rv $X$ and a function $f$ that is positive (non-negative) and  increasing (non-decreasing).
\begin{enumerate}
\item Why is this true for any $a$: $f(a) \1{X\geq a} \leq f(X) \1{X\geq a} \leq f(X)$?
\item Take expectations and use the fundamental bridge to show that $\P{X\geq a} \leq \E{f(X)}/f(a)$.
\item What part of the proof goes wrong if  $f$ can also be negative?
\item Show that Markov's inequality follows by taking $Y=|X|$ and  $f(x)=x$. Why don't we take $f(x) = |x|$?
\item Show that Chebyshev's inequality follows by taking $Y=|X-\mu|$ and $f(x)=x^2$.
\item Show that Chernoff's inequality follows by taking $f(x)=e^{x}$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}
Use Eve's law to show that $\V Y \geq \V{\E{Y\given X}}$.
\end{exercise}

\subsection{Coding skills}

\begin{exercise}
Let us try to understand the weak law of large numbers by means of simulation. An easy example is to take $X_{i}\sim\Unif{0,1}$, so that is what we do here.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Explain lines 9 and 10 of the python code.
\item What is \texttt{Y}, i.e., the result of line 15 of the python code? What is the symbol that BH use for this?
\item What do lines P.17 and P.18 compute?
\item What is P.20 in the notation of BH?
\item What inequality do we check in P.21?
\item Choose some different values for $n$ and the sample size $N$. Is the inequality always true?
\end{enumerate}

\begin{minted}[]{python}
import numpy as np
from numpy.random import uniform

np.random.seed(3)

n = 10
N = 50 # num samples

mu = 1 / 2
var = 1 / 12
eps = 0.1

X = uniform(size=[num_samples, n])

Y = X.mean(axis=1)

larger = np.abs(Y - mu) > eps
count = larger.sum()
P = count / N
RHS = var / (n * eps * eps)
print(P, RHS)
\end{minted}

\end{exercise}
